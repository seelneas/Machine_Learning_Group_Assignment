# Machine Learning Group Assignment

This repository contains two Machine Learning Group Projects.

# ML Regression Problem

STOCK PRICE PREDICTION 

This project demonstrates how to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques in Python. The model is trained on historical stock data and can be used to forecast future prices.

Regression Models

- Linear Regression 

- Ridge Regrerssion

- Support Vector Regression

# ML Classification Problem

EMAIL SPAM DETECTION

This project implements a simple email spam detection system using Classifiers in Python. The model is trained on spam dataset and uses basic text feature extraction to classify messages as spam or not spam (ham).

Classification Models

- Decision Tree

- Random Forest

- Logisitic Regression
